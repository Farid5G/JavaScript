In Javascript, appendChild and removeChild are two essential methods used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) by adding and removing nodes, respectively. Here's a breakdown of each:

1.appendChild:

Function: Takes a child node as an argument and adds it as the last child of the element on which the method is called.

2.removeChild:

Function: Takes a child node as an argument and removes it from the DOM tree. It returns the removed node.
